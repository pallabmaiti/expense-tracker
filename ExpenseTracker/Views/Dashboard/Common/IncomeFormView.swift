/// A SwiftUI view that provides a form for user input related to income entries.
/// 
/// `IncomeFormView` is a reusable form component for collecting and editing income information. 
/// It includes fields for the amount, income source, note (conditionally if the source is `.other`), and date.
/// 
/// - Parameters:
///   - amount: A binding to the income amount as a `Double`.
///   - source: A binding to the selected `Source` of income.
///   - note: A binding to an optional note describing the income (shown only if `source` is `.other`).
///   - date: A binding to the `Date` the income was received.
/// 
/// The form uses custom labeled field views to improve usability and consistency.
